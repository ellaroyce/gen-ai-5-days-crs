You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n\n\n## Before you begin\n\nIn this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n\n* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n\n\n### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n\nIn the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n\nBoth APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n\nAI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n\nIf you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers.","metadata":{"id":"csNPnkuCobmG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Get started with Kaggle notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using a Kaggle notebook, welcome!

Adventure had called, soft and enticing as a purr, through the crack in the window. The old fishing boat swaying gently at the edge of the pier had whispered tales of distant shores and swirling seas— the very ocean that dreamt through Mitzi’s sleep.\n\nSilently, with the stealth of a shadow, she slipped out, using the fishing nets as stepping stones, a tiny predator traversing a pirate's path. The boat bobbed temptingly, whispering invitations with the murmur of the waves. Mitzi, fearless adventurer, climbed aboard, its creaky frame groaning beneath her weight.\n\nThe setting sun bathed the ocean in golden hues as Mitzi scurried forward, nose twitching at the savory scent of salt and fresh fish. In the distance, a cluster of small islands emerged, looking like emerald gems scattered across a sapphire canvas. Excitement buzzed in Mitzi’s belly, a joyful melody humming in her heart.\n\nThe boat, a lazy sentinel borne on the whims of the tide, drifted towards the islands. The journey itself brimmed with wonder – a tapestry woven with the playful kisses of sea spray, the calls of distant seagulls, and the breathtaking panorama of rippling water beneath the star-dusted sky. Mitzi, nestled atop the boat’s mast, felt a sense of liberation, like a feathered hawk tracing circles in the heavens. \n\nOne of the islands, closer than the rest, beckoned with the alluring sweetness of fruits - ripe and plump, bursting with sun-kissed juices. Mitzi, drawn in by the tantalizing aroma, clambered ashore. It resembled a tropical paradise, with lush foliage and whispering palms casting intriguing shadows along a white sand beach adorned with strange and curious shells. Mitzi explored this unfamiliar Eden - a haven of birdsong and rustling fronds, where butterflies, rainbow-winged and dazzling, waltzed with the summer breeze. \n\nThough a stranger in this beautiful place, Mitzi felt at home, her heart brimming with a peaceful joy, a sense of completeness only found in a solitary heart that embraced pure contentment. Under a sky shimmering with fireflies, Mitzi, adventurer by destiny and explorer by chance, basked in the serenity, a little furry traveler having reached her perfect haven. \n\nSunrise touched the horizon – a breathtaking, fiery spectacle mirrored upon the crystal clear waters. Relinquishing her solitude, as though pulled by an unseen force, Mitzi set her sights on the distant silhouette of her familiar world - her home, her safe haven which hadn’t even noticed her absence. She meowed, longing for its quiet comfort as she gazed upon a ship, a tiny speck on the horizon, a silent invitation to a new beginning.  The cat adventurer, a brave heart on an ocean of dreams, was returning home a little wiser, knowing one doesn’t always have to leave to have a good adventure. \n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":13},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Prompting\n\nThis section contains some prompts from the chapter for you to try out directly in the API.

This includes:\n    * The branch name you're on.\n    * Whether you're ahead or behind the remote branch.\n    * Information about staged, unstaged, and untracked files.\n    * Optional features like showing the username and repository name.\n* **Offers customization:** The script lets you configure the look and feel of your prompt. You can:\n    * Choose from a variety of color themes.\n    * Set custom colors and symbols.\n    * Control which elements are displayed.\n* **Works with virtual environments:** The script can display the name of your active virtual environment (if you use Python's `virtualenv` or similar).\n* **Automatic updates:**  The script automatically updates the prompt with the latest Git information every time you run a command. This keeps you informed of the state of your repository without needing to manually run `git status`.\n\n**Why would you use it?**\n\n* **Enhanced productivity:** The script gives you immediate visibility into your Git repository's status, saving you time and effort when working on projects.\n* **Improved workflow:** The script makes it easier to navigate and manage your projects by providing contextually relevant information right in your prompt.\n* **Customization:** You can tailor the prompt to fit your preferences and coding style.\n\n**To use this script:**\n\n1. **Save the code** into a file named `git-prompt.sh` in a suitable directory.\n2. **Source the script** in your shell's configuration file (`.bashrc` for Bash, `.zshrc` for Zsh). \n3. **Restart your shell** or source the file again to load the script.\n\nYou can then customize the script's settings (like color themes, symbols, and elements) by changing the variables within the file."},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":28},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Learn more\n\nTo learn more about prompting in depth:\n\n* Check out the whitepaper issued with today's content,\n* Try out the apps listed at the top of this notebook ([TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/), [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) and [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/)),\n* Read the [Introduction to Prompting](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting-intro) from the Gemini API docs,\n* Explore the Gemini API's [prompt gallery](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/prompts) and try them out in AI Studio,\n* Check out the Gemini API cookbook for [inspirational examples](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/examples/) and [educational quickstarts](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/).\n\nAnd please share anything exciting you have tried in the Discord!","metadata":{"id":"2a8266d97ce5"}}]}
